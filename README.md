# DeepSenseTF2
This is an upgrade for DeepSense using Tensorflow2.

Based on the work of https://github.com/yscacaca/DeepSense and the Dataset upgrade of https://github.com/zhezh/DeepSense, I re-wrote the HHAR task of DeepSense using TensorFlow 2. The network is designed in a modular way to add as much sensors as needed and configure the kernels and strides depending on the training and design needs.
